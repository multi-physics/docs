# **Fidelics**
 is designed to be extendable Multiphyiscs simulation platform, which provide one or multiple(couping) of the following physics, in a unified framework:
1. low mach incompressible flow
2. subsonic, transonic and supersonic compressible flow
3. multiphase flow
4. multispecies flow
5. thermal-dyanimcs
6. aerodynamic acostics
7. linear static and dynamic structral mechanics
